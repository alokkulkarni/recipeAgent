# Test Approach Document for Flutter Sprint FLUT1

## 1. Introduction
The Flutter project sprint FLUT1 includes four new stories with distinct features: AI-driven onboarding, personalized customer rewards, biometric authentication, and improvements to the waiting list experience. This document outlines the strategic and tactical testing approaches aimed at ensuring quality delivery aligned with sprint goals.

## 2. Test Planning Details
- Sprint duration: 2025-09-22 to 2025-10-06
- Focus on testing newly developed stories: FLUT-1, FLUT-2, FLUT-3, FLUT-4
- Collaboration with product owners, developers, and QA

## 3. Test Design Approach
- Utilize Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) methodologies for test case design
- Implement Test-Driven Development (TDD) particularly for the AI and biometric authentication modules
- Define acceptance criteria tests based on user stories

## 4. Test Execution Strategy
- Execute unit and integration tests continuously during development
- Conduct system and user acceptance tests towards sprint end
- Exploratory testing sessions planned post core testing

## 5. Test Data and Environment Management
- Use anonymized real production data where possible for rewards and biometric features
- Environment setup aligns with production-like configuration for system and acceptance testing

## 6. Test Automation Strategy
- Leverage existing automation framework with enhancements for the new features
- Integrate automated tests into CI/CD pipelines for daily builds
- Prioritize automation of smoke, regression, and critical path tests

## 7. Reporting and Metrics
- Daily test execution status reports
- Defect logging and tracking through Jira
- Metrics on test coverage, defect density, and automation progress

## 8. Agile Testing Approaches Framework
- Continuous testing integrated into Agile sprints
- Regular participation in sprint planning and retrospectives
- Three Amigos sessions for requirement clarifications

## 9. Testing Approach Selection Guide
- Map complex, new functionalities (AI onboarding, biometric) to automated and exploratory testing
- Use manual testing for UI/UX and new rewards workflows
- Regression tests automated across all areas

## 10. Sprint-Specific Testing Implementation
- Each story targeted with specific test suites:
  - FLUT-1: AI onboarding workflow scenarios
  - FLUT-2: Rewards calculation and redemption
  - FLUT-3: Authentication flows and security
  - FLUT-4: Waiting list usability and performance
