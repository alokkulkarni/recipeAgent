# Test Plan Document for Flutter Sprint FLUT1

## Step 1: Requirements Understanding
- Gathered from Jira stories FLUT-1, FLUT-2, FLUT-3, FLUT-4
- Key features: AI onboarding, personalized rewards, biometric authentication, waiting list improvements

## Step 2: Test Objectives and Scope Definition
- Objectives: Validate features, ensure security and usability, verify acceptance criteria
- Scope: Testing only new sprint FLUT1 user stories

## Step 3: Test Approach Selection
- Use BDD and TDD for test design
- Automated unit, integration, and E2E tests
- Manual exploratory and usability tests

## Step 4: Test Environment and Data Requirements
- Development, QA, UAT, and production-like environments
- Anonymized production data for realistic testing

## Step 5: Test Design and Execution Planning
- Map stories to test scenarios
- Prioritize tests by risk and complexity
- Continuous execution throughout sprint

## Step 6: Testing Resources Allocation
- QA engineers for automation and manual testing
- Developers for unit tests and TDD
- Product owners for acceptance criteria

## Step 7: Defect Management Process
- Defect logging and tracking in Jira
- Prioritization and triage during daily standups
- Regression tests to verify fixes

## Step 8: Testing Timelines Establishment
- Aligned with sprint start and end dates
- Daily test status updates
- Milestone reviews mid-sprint and pre-release

## Step 9: Communication and Collaboration Plan
- Daily standups and sprint reviews
- Three Amigos sessions for clarification
- Continuous feedback loop with CI/CD integrations
