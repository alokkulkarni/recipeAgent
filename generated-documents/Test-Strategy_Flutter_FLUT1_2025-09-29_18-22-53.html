# Test Strategy Document for Flutter Sprint FLUT1

## 1. Executive Summary
- **Testing Scope and Objectives:**
  This testing effort for the Flutter project focuses on validating four key new user stories within sprint FLUT1: AI-driven onboarding, personalized customer rewards, biometric authentication, and improving the waiting list experience. The objective is to ensure these functionalities are delivered with high quality to support an enhanced user experience.
- **Key Testing Milestones and Deliverables:**
  Testing will be aligned with the sprint period from 2025-09-22 to 2025-10-06, delivering comprehensive test coverage, automated regression suites, and detailed defect reports by sprint end.
- **High-Level Risk Assessment:**
  Key risks include potential integration issues with biometric systems, accuracy of AI onboarding algorithms, security of personalized rewards data, and usability challenges in the waiting list feature.

## 2. Vision and Mission Definition
- **Overall Mission/Purpose:**
  To deliver working software that meets customer requirements through continuous feedback and defect prevention for the Flutter mobile application.
- **Testing Objectives:**
  - Early defect detection across new AI, biometric, rewards, and UI components.
  - Maintain high quality and regression stability to support rapid releases.
  - Mitigate business and technical risks by comprehensive functional and non-functional testing.
  - Verify that all acceptance criteria are met for each user story.

## 3. Test Scope
- **In Scope:**
  - AI-driven onboarding workflow (FLUT-1)
  - Personalized customer rewards system (FLUT-2)
  - Biometric authentication features (FLUT-3)
  - Waiting list experience improvements (FLUT-4)
- **Out of Scope:**
  - Legacy features and previous sprint scope items not related to FLUT1
  - Non-functional testing beyond biometric security and basic performance
- **Assumptions:**
  - Requirements and acceptance criteria will be clarified and detailed by product owners before execution.
  - Test environments will be provisioned reflecting production where possible.
- **Prioritization Strategy:**
  - Focus on high-risk modules: biometric authentication and AI onboarding.
  - Prioritize customer-impacting features such as rewards and waiting list improvements.

## 4. Test Approach and Types

### Test Levels (Test Pyramid Implementation)
| Test Level           | Coverage           | Speed   | Complexity | Purpose                             |
|----------------------|--------------------|---------|------------|-----------------------------------|
| Unit Tests (Base)     | 70-80%             | Fast    | Low        | Component verification, fast feedback |
| Integration Tests     | 15-20%             | Moderate| Medium     | Interface and integration validation |
| End-to-End Tests (Top)| 5-10%              | Slow    | High       | Critical workflow validation       |

### Types of Testing Strategy
**Functional Testing:**
- Unit testing for internal logic of AI onboarding, biometric, rewards modules
- Integration testing for components interaction
- System testing to verify complete workflows
- User acceptance testing with product owners for business validation

**Non-Functional Testing:**
- Performance testing focusing on authentication and onboarding responsiveness
- Security testing for biometric data and rewards system
- Usability testing on waiting list improvements
- Compatibility testing across supported devices

**Specialized Testing Approaches:**
- Regression testing automation to safeguard existing features
- Exploratory testing to uncover defects not covered by scripted tests
- Static analysis for code quality
- Preventive testing with early feedback loops

### Automation Strategy
- High ROI automation on smoke and regression test suites
- Automated API tests for backend service validation
- UI automation using Playwright for cross-platform tests
- Mobile automation with Appium for device-specific testing

## 5. Test Objectives
- Validate new features per user story requirements
- Ensure robustness, security, and usability of new functionalities
- Success measured by meeting story acceptance criteria with zero critical defects

## 6. Roles and Responsibilities

| Role            | Testing Responsibilities                  | Quality Activities                    |
